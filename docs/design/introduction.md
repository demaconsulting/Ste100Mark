# Introduction

This document provides the detailed design for the Ste100Mark, a .NET command-line
application demonstrating best practices for DEMA Consulting DotNet Tools. It covers local
software items (systems, subsystems, and units) and the OTS software items they consume.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the internal design of each software unit that
comprises the Ste100Mark. It captures data models, algorithms, key methods, and
inter-unit interactions at a level of detail sufficient for formal code review, compliance
verification, and future maintenance. A reviewer should be able to understand how each item
satisfies its requirements without reading source code. The document does not restate
requirements; it explains how they are realized.

## Scope

Local items:

- **Ste100Mark**: system, subsystem, and unit design for all local components.

OTS items:

- **BuildMark**: integration and usage design.
- **FileAssert**: integration and usage design.
- **Pandoc**: integration and usage design.
- **ReqStream**: integration and usage design.
- **ReviewMark**: integration and usage design.
- **SarifMark**: integration and usage design.
- **SonarMark**: integration and usage design.
- **SysML2Tools**: integration and usage design.
- **VersionMark**: integration and usage design.
- **WeasyPrint**: integration and usage design.
- **xUnit**: integration and usage design.

The following topics are out of scope:

- Design documents are not produced for the test projects or build pipeline CI configuration
- The internal design of OTS software items is excluded; only integration and usage design is documented

## Software Structure

The software structure is modeled in SysML2 under `docs/sysml2/` and rendered to the diagram
below by SysML2Tools as part of the build pipeline. The SysML2 model is the authoritative source
for the system, subsystem, and unit hierarchy. AI agents should query the SysML2 model directly
(see the `sysml2tools-query` skill) rather than parsing this diagram or the prose elsewhere in
this document. Any hand-maintained prose in this introduction that describes structure or item
relationships is illustrative and explanatory only; if it differs from the model, the model takes
precedence. The model captures the shipped system's runtime composition only; the OTS items listed
in Scope above are build-time/pipeline tooling, documented separately (see `docs/design/ots.md`)
rather than modeled as SysML2 parts.

## Folder Layout

- **src/** - source files and projects
  - **DemaConsulting.Ste100Mark/** - main application source
    - **Cli/** - command-line interface subsystem
    - **SelfTest/** - self-validation subsystem
    - **Utilities/** - shared utilities subsystem

## Document Conventions

Throughout this document:

- Class names, method names, property names, and file names appear in `monospace` font.
- The word **shall** denotes a design constraint that the implementation must satisfy.
- Section headings within each unit chapter follow a consistent structure: overview, data model,
  methods/algorithms, and interactions with other units.
- Text tables are used in preference to diagrams, which may not render in all PDF viewers.

## Companion Artifact Structure

Local software items have corresponding artifacts in parallel directory trees:

- Requirements: `docs/reqstream/{system-name}/.../{item}.yaml` for system artifacts and deeper
  descendants such as `docs/reqstream/{system-name}/{subsystem-name}.yaml` or
  `docs/reqstream/{system-name}/{subsystem-name}/{unit-name}.yaml` (kebab-case)
- Design docs: `docs/design/{system-name}.md` for the system document, with descendants under
  `docs/design/{system-name}/...` such as `docs/design/{system-name}/{subsystem-name}.md` or
  `docs/design/{system-name}/{subsystem-name}/{unit-name}.md` (kebab-case)
- Verification design: `docs/verification/{system-name}.md` for the system document, with
  descendants under `docs/verification/{system-name}/...` using the same pattern (kebab-case)
- Source code: `src/{System}/.../{Item}.cs` (PascalCase for C#)
- Tests: `test/{System}.Tests/.../{Item}Tests.cs` (PascalCase for C#)

OTS items have integration/usage design documentation parallel to system folders:

- Requirements: `docs/reqstream/ots/{ots-name}.yaml`
- Design: `docs/design/ots/{ots-name}.md`
- Verification: `docs/verification/ots/{ots-name}.md`

Review-sets: defined in `.reviewmark.yaml`
