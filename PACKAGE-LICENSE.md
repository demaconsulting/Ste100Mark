# License of the DemaConsulting.Ste100Mark Package

The NuGet package `DemaConsulting.Ste100Mark` contains the code of the tool and bundles the `DemaConsulting.PartOfSpeech`
assembly, which embeds two files of data. The tool code is licensed under the MIT License. The bundled dependency data
comes from third parties and is licensed under the terms below. The first line of this file is the SPDX license
expression that covers the whole package; it is a hint for license scanners, and this file is the license. nuget.org
accepts only license expressions that the Open Source
Initiative or the Free Software Foundation approve, and `CC-BY-3.0-US` is neither, so the package names this file
instead of an expression.

## Data Embedded in This Package

The assembly embeds two binary files. Each is derived from the third-party works named below, was adapted by DEMA
Consulting, and is not the original data.

### The lexicon (`lexicon.bin`): CC BY 4.0 and CC BY 3.0 US

The lexicon maps a lower-case English spelling to the Universal POS tags that it may carry. It is derived from the word
forms of Open English WordNet 2025 Edition, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
License (CC BY 4.0, <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>), and which is derived from Princeton WordNet. The
tags that the lexicon lists are attested in the Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus (MASC), which is licensed under the
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License (CC BY 3.0 US,
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/>), and in the open corpus of this project (CC0 1.0). It also uses the
Moby Part-of-Speech List, which is in the public domain.

### The weights (`weights.bin`): CC BY 3.0 US

The weights are the trained model of the tagger. They were learned from five corpora of this project, which are not
part of the package:

- the open corpus (CC0 1.0), with Universal POS tags that language models wrote;
- the written texts of MASC, whose Penn Treebank part-of-speech tags were converted to Universal POS tags (CC BY 3.0 US);
- a silver corpus of Tatoeba (CC0 1.0) and Project Gutenberg (public domain in the United States) sentences, tagged by a
  language model (CC0 1.0);
- an imperative source of sentences from US federal government documents (public domain under 17 U.S.C. 105), tagged by
  language models (CC0 1.0);
- a compound source of sentences with a noun compound, from US federal government documents (public domain under
  17 U.S.C. 105), tagged by language models (CC0 1.0).

A further training source of the repository (heading lines from US federal government documents, tagged by language
models, CC0 1.0) has weight 0 in the training configuration: it is not part of the mix, and the weights were not learned
from it.

Because the weights were trained on data adapted from MASC, they are provided under the terms of its license. The
authors of Open English WordNet, Princeton University and the authors of MASC do not endorse this project, the lexicon
or the weights.

## Attribution and Where to Find It

The attribution, license links, citation and statement of changes that these licenses require are in the file
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` at the root of this package, which also reproduces the Princeton WordNet license notice. This
file and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` together are the complete notices of the package. Keep both with every copy of the
package that you redistribute. The source data and the tools that produce the embedded files are in the repository
<https://github.com/demaconsulting/PartOfSpeech> (folders `data/` and `tools/`); the repository `LICENSE` file is the
